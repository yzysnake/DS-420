        "## Due: Midnight, September 16th\n",
        "In this lab, we will introduce Tweepy, an open-sourced Python Package to communicate with Twitter platform and use its API. We will teach you how to use Tweepy to access Twitter data, such as user profiles and following list. In lab 2, we will further use Tweepy to collect Twitter network. We provide examples and most of the code for you. You will need to fill in some of the codes. You can also read the domcumentation of Tweepy to learn more about it: https://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\n",
